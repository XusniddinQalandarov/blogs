    "intro": "We use <code>getter</code> & <code>setter</code> to detect changes to an <code>@Input</code> property in Angular. There's also another way to do this: <code>NgOnChanges</code>, which we will discuss later in the article.",

    "whatIsHappeningTitle": "What's Happening?",
    "whatIsHappening": "In this setup, the Child component creates the object, and the Parent component can change the object's value using buttons (Messi or Ronaldo). Since the initial player name is set to <code>null</code>, the name won't appear on the screen until a button is pressed."

  "powerGetters": {
    "title": "The Power of Getters and Setters in TypeScript",
    "intro": "When we work with <code>classes</code> in object-oriented programming, encapsulation is a key concept. It's all about bundling data (<code>properties</code>) and <code>methods</code> that operate on that data within a single unit – the <code>class</code>. Part of this means controlling access to a <code>class</code>'s internal state. Let's see why this is important and how <code>getters</code> and <code>setters</code> come to the rescue.",
    "challengeTitle": "The Challenge: Direct Access and Its Pitfalls",
    "challengeDesc": "Imagine we have a simple <code>Product</code> class:",
    "solutionTitle": "The Solution: Introducing Getters and Setters",
    "solutionIntro": "This is where <code>getters</code> and <code>setters</code> shine! They are special <code>methods</code> that provide read and write access to an object's <code>properties</code> while allowing you to add logic before returning or setting a value.",
    "solutionDetail": "Let’s refactor our <code>Product</code> class. We'll conventionally prefix the <code>private</code> property with an underscore (e.g., <code>_id</code>) and then define public <code>get</code> and <code>set</code> accessors for it:",
    "solutionAfterCode": "Now, when you write <code>bread.id = 2;</code>, you're not directly accessing a field. Instead, you're calling the <code>set id(newId: number)</code> method. Similarly, reading <code>bread.id</code> calls the <code>get id(): number</code> method. This works perfectly fine and allows us to embed logic, like validation or logging, within these accessors.",
    "whyBotherTitle": "Why Bother?",
    "reasonEncapsulation": "<strong>Encapsulation:</strong> Protects the internal state of an object.",
    "reasonControlledAccess": "<strong>Controlled Access:</strong> You decide how <code>properties</code> are read and written.",
    "reasonValidation": "<strong>Data Validation:</strong> Implement checks before a <code>property</code> value is changed (as seen with the positive ID check).",
    "reasonComputedProperties": "<strong>Computed Properties:</strong> <code>Getters</code> can return values derived from other <code>properties</code>.",
    "reasonSideEffects": "<strong>Side Effects:</strong> Perform actions (like logging or triggering events) when a <code>property</code> is accessed or modified.",
    "concluding": "<code>Getters</code> and <code>setters</code> are fundamental tools in creating robust, maintainable, and flexible <code>classes</code> in TypeScript and many other object-oriented languages. They allow you to expose a clean public <code>API</code> while keeping the internal workings of your <code>class</code> neatly tucked away."

  "controlFlow": {
  "title": "Angular Control-Flow: *ngIf vs @if, *ngFor vs @for & @switch",
  "intro": "In Angular you've traditionally used <code>*ngIf</code>, <code>*ngFor</code> and <code>[ngSwitch]</code> for conditional and list rendering. As of v16 there are also the new <code>@if</code>, <code>@for</code> and <code>@switch</code> syntaxes that look and feel more like plain JavaScript, reduce boilerplate and improve readability.",
  "ifVsNgIfTitle": "*ngIf vs @if",
  "ifVsNgIfDesc": "<code>*ngIf</code> is Angular's built-in structural directive for conditionally including a template. <code>@if</code> offers a more concise, JS-style syntax for the same use case.",
  "nestedIfDesc": "With <code>*ngIf</code>+<code>ng-template</code> you use an <code>else</code> template block, whereas <code>@if</code> lets you write <code>@else</code> directly in the same block.",
  "forVsNgForTitle": "*ngFor vs @for",
  "forVsNgForDesc": "<code>*ngFor</code> iterates over a collection in the template. <code>@for</code> gives you a cleaner loop syntax and even supports an <code>@empty</code> clause for handling empty arrays.",
  "trackFeatureTitle": "Optimizing with track vs trackBy",
  "trackFeatureDesc": "In <code>*ngFor</code> you pass a <code>trackBy</code> function to optimize <code>DOM</code> updates. In <code>@for</code> you simply add <code>track item.id</code> to the loop declaration for the same effect.",
  "switchVsNgSwitchTitle": "*ngSwitch vs @switch",
  "switchVsNgSwitchDesc": "<code>*ngSwitch</code> provides <code>switch-case-default</code> in your template. <code>@switch</code> brings a JS-style <code>@case</code> and <code>@default</code> directly into your markup.",
  "conclusion": "Angular v16's new control-flow directives (<code>@if</code>, <code>@for</code>, <code>@switch</code>) complement the traditional <code>*ngIf</code>, <code>*ngFor</code> and <code>[ngSwitch]</code>, giving you a more JavaScript-like syntax that cuts boilerplate and makes templates easier to read."
